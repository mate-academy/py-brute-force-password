# Brute Force Passwords

**Please note:** read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md)
before starting.

Imagine yourself a hacker. You've successfully SQL-injected some website's DB and got hashed passwords of 10 users.
```python
PASSWORDS_TO_BRUTE_FORCE = [
    "b4061a4bcfe1a2cbf78286f3fab2fb578266d1bd16c414c650c5ac04dfc696e1",

```
Of course, your first thought was to look through rainbow tables and test your luck. 
But you visited that website and understand that its password field accepts only numeric symbols from 0 to 9. 
There is a limitation — the password length always must be 8 symbols (extremely weak security — you must agree). 
Also, it seems that this website doesn't use any additional security while hashing their passwords (like salting).

So, you as a hacker already got a point, that you can easily brute force all possible variants of passwords
and check the corresponding hashes using this `sha256_hash_str` function:
```python
import sha256


def sha256_hash_str(to_hash: str) -> str:
    return sha256(to_hash.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
```

Your task is to find these 10 passwords (8-numeric symbols strings) and print them to the console.


Notes:
- you should find `10` passwords (not `9`) — check it;
- you should use setup to speed up this brute forcing as much as possible;
- attach the screenshot of your script results (the console) to the PR.
