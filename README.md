# Brute Force Passwords

Imagine you're a hacker. You've successfully SQL-injected some website's DB and got hashed passwords of 10 users:

```python
PASSWORDS_TO_BRUTE_FORCE = [
    "b4061a4bcfe1a2cbf78286f3fab2fb578266d1bd16c414c650c5ac04dfc696e1",
    "cf0b0cfc90d8b4be14e00114827494ed5522e9aa1c7e6960515b58626cad0b44",
    "e34efeb4b9538a949655b788dcb517f4a82e997e9e95271ecd392ac073fe216d",
    "c15f56a2a392c950524f499093b78266427d21291b7d7f9d94a09b4e41d65628",
    "4cd1a028a60f85a1b94f918adb7fb528d7429111c52bb2aa2874ed054a5584dd",
    "40900aa1d900bee58178ae4a738c6952cb7b3467ce9fde0c3efa30a3bde1b5e2",
    "5e6bc66ee1d2af7eb3aad546e9c0f79ab4b4ffb04a1bc425a80e6a4b0f055c2e",
    "1273682fa19625ccedbe2de2817ba54dbb7894b7cefb08578826efad492f51c9",
    "7e8f0ada0a03cbee48a0883d549967647b3fca6efeb0a149242f19e4b68d53d6",
    "e5f3ff26aa8075ce7513552a9af1882b4fbc2a47a3525000f6eb887ab9622207",
]
```

Of course, your first thought was to look through rainbow tables and test your luck.  
But after visiting the website, you realized that its password field only accepts numeric symbols from `0` to `9`.  

Thereâ€™s a limitation â€” the password must always be **8 numeric symbols long** (*extremely weak security â€” you must agree*).  
Also, it seems that this website doesnâ€™t use any additional security while hashing their passwords (like salting).

So, as a hacker, you quickly figured out that you can brute force all possible password variants  
and check the corresponding hashes using the `sha256_hash_str` function:

```python
import sha256


def sha256_hash_str(to_hash: str) -> str:
    return sha256(to_hash.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
```

Find the **10 passwords** (each an 8-character numeric string) and print them to the console.

- You should find **10** passwords (*not 9*) â€” double-check your results.
- Optimize your brute-force setup as much as possible to speed up the process.
- Attach a **screenshot of your script results (console output)** to the PR.
